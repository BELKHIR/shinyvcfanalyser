\description{
Collect CLUMPP output files from multiple folders to one folder
}
\details{
Within each CLUMPP output folder, the function searches for 
filenames containing combination of prefix and filetype. This file is 
copied to the new folder. Therefore, do not manually rename CLUMPP output 
files or output directories.

See the \href{http://royfrancis.github.io/pophelper/}{vignette} for more 
details.
