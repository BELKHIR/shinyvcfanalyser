\title{Convert STRUCTURE run files to qlist.}
\usage{
readQStructure(files = NULL, indlabfromfile = FALSE, readci = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character or character vector of one or more STRUCTURE run 
files. Use \code{choose.files(multi=TRUE)} 
to select interactively.}

\item{indlabfromfile}{A logical indicating if individual labels must be read 
from input file and used as row names for resulting dataframe. Spaces in 
labels may be replaced with _.}

\item{readci}{A logical indicating if confidence intervals from the structure
file (if available) should be read. Set to FALSE by default as it take up 
excess space.}
}
\value{
A list of lists with dataframes is returned. If individual labels are 
present in the STRUCTURE file, they are added to the dataframe as row names. 
Structure metadata including loci, burnin, reps, elpd, mvll, and vll is added 
as attributes to each dataframe. When \code{readci=TRUE} and if CI data is
available, it is read in and attached as attribute named ci. List items are 
named by input filenames.
}
\description{
Takes one or more STRUCTURE run files and converts them to a 
list of dataframes.

\examples{
sfiles <- list.files(path=system.file("files/structure",package="pophelper"),
full.names=TRUE)
# create a qlist of all runs
slist <- readQStructure(sfiles)

# use ind names from file
slist <- readQStructure(sfiles[1],indlabfromfile=TRUE)

# access the first run
slist <- readQStructure(sfiles)[[1]]

# access names of runs
names(slist)
}
