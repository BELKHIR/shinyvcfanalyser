\usage{
collectRunsTess(runsdir = NA, newdir = NA, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{runsdir}{A character path indicating the directory containing TESS 
runs in multiple directories. Use \code{choose.dir()} for interactively 
selecting the directory. If NA, or no directory is selected, the current 
working directory is used.}

\item{newdir}{A character indicating the name of the new directory to be 
created with the collected runs. IF NA, the default name 'AllTESSRuns' is 
used.}

\item{quiet}{A logical indicating if a message is to be displayed for 
directories without TESS runs and number of runs copied and renamed.}
}
\value{
Two integers are ruturned. The first denotes the number of TESS run 
files copied and renamed. The second number denotes number of directories 
without TESS run files.
}
\description{
Collect TESS cluster run files from multiple folders to one 
folder and rename each run by folder name
}
\details{
Within each TESS run folder, the function searches for filename 
ending with 'TR.txt' as the cluster file. This file is copied to the new 
folder and renamed as the name of the respective run directory. Therefore, 
DO NOT manually rename original run files or directories.

See the vignette for more details.
